# gulp-sass-scaffolding

Silly scaffolding made public for sass with gulp.

I'm also using:

* postcss,

* autoprefixer,

* cssnano...

And I'll be using some *ES6*. So you better have node^v6. ^__^


## Installation

(`sudo`) `npm i`

## Usage

Srsly, just read the `gulpfile`. It's pretty short.

Run the `sass`+`watch` tasks with the `default` one:

```
$ gulp
```

## Files

You should delete the `_sample.scss` file. It's just an example. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
